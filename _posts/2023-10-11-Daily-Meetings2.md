### Plan for Each Person

Gavin: Finish with the background and the sprite
John: Work on the mario hacks to implement into our game
Ian: Finish bridge and invert images for sprite
Matthew: Find good sprites and work on the menu

All of these should be in different time box hacks and worked on separately. In the next coming weeks we will combine everything together to make a great game.
