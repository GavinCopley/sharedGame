# What We Learned:

- Matthew: I learned to how to code a main menu for the game, which requires the use of buttons and modifying code. I also learned how to work with Ian in order to create the main menu.

- Ian: I learned the purpose of classes, and that its similar to div classes in html. I'm thinking of using div classes in order to set up stuff into catargories, and be able to put links to possibly link to the actual game.

- Gavin: I learned how to use functions to draw and update the player and other objects. This is extremely important for providing visuals to play the game and providing guidance for the player. Without a floor, you can't walk, and without platforms there is no game. I used all of this knowledge in building the base of the game. From here, I can add things like paralax, a sprite animation, and one or more levels to play.

- John: I learned and am currently learning how to use pixilart to make sprites for our game. I am admittedly not good at art, but I am trying. I was attempting to make a game before, but unfortunately, my ~30 minutes of progress on the game just got wiped and I couldn't figure out how to get it back, so now I'm making sprites for our game. I have a long way to go for the sprites, but it's going well so far.
