## What we did and learned this week

John: I worked on player rotation. I don't think we intend to implement this into our game, but I did it to test myself and learn more code. I was able to get the player to rotate -15 degrees but that was it. For some reason, anything else but -15 breaks it and the character then doesn't rotate. That's why I labelled it as a WIP (Work in Progress) in one of the previous review tickets. I am also working on the death pits, which currently is being very buggy but I am working through it.
