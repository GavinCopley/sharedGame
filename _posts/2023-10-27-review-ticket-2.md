## What we accomplished and learned this week

John: I am still unable to make the player rotate in any other way than -15 degrees. I have officially moved on from this because we are probably not going to use this anyways. I was able to get the black pit to reset the character to a certain point. It doesn't really look like a pit, but rather just a really fat black line of pixels. It slightly sticks out of the ground. The collision seems to work well.
